# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


### `Issue`

I have an issue with the chart endpoint as it returns <b>CORS ERROR</b> so I get the data from postman response and create a dummey-data.json file 
and get the data from this JSON file and make the filteration on local

### `chart package`

I used <b>APEXCHARTS</b> package because it gives me the ability:
- to make chart responsive
- display chart data with animation
- option to zoom-in and zoom-out in the chart
- able to customize style and tooltip
- free to use
